/**
 * 1680. Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Given an integer n, return the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of 1 to n in order, modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: "1" in binary corresponds to the decimal value 1. 
Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 27
Explanation: In binary, 1, 2, and 3 corresponds to "1", "10", and "11".
After concatenating them, we have "11011", which corresponds to the decimal value 27.
Example 3:
Input: n = 12
Output: 505379714
Explanation: The concatenation results in "1101110010111011110001001101010111100".
The decimal value of that is 118505380540.
After modulo 109 + 7, the result is 505379714.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105

/**
 * Intuition
Instead of actually building the binary string (which would be too large), we simulate concatenation using bit manipulation. When appending a number i to the current result, we left shift the result by the number of bits in i and then add i.

Approach
Maintain a variable bits representing the number of bits in the current number i.

The number of bits increases only when i is a power of 2.

Detect power of 2 using (i & (i-1)) == 0.

For each i from 1 to n:

If i is a power of 2, increment bits.
Left shift the result by bits and OR with i.
Take modulo to avoid overflow.
Small explanation for (i & (i-1)) == 0:
A power of 2 has only one set bit in binary. Subtracting 1 flips that bit and all bits to its right. Performing AND between i and i-1 results in 0 only for powers of 2.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

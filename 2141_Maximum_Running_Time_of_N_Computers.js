/**
 * 2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * 
 * You have n computers. You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed integer array batteries where the ith battery can run a computer for batteries[i] minutes. You are interested in running all n computers simultaneously using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of times. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the n computers simultaneously.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.

Example 2:


Input: n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. 
After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. 
After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 105
1 <= batteries[i] <= 109

/**
 * Intuition
The approach distributes battery power among computers. If power can be distributed perfectly, the runtime is:

n
total battery
​
 
​
 
This average represents an upper bound on the achievable runtime.

Greedy Approach
Some batteries may contain more power than the average allocation.

These batteries could power one computer for the entire duration while retaining unused charge.

Compare the average runtime with the largest battery.

If the largest battery exceeds this average, assign it to one computer permanently.
The problem reduces to the remaining batteries and n−1 computers.
Continue this process until the largest remaining battery satisfies:

max(battery)≤ 
n
total battery
​
 
​
 
At this point, the remaining batteries can be distributed through swapping without waste.

When this condition holds, the maximum battery operates at full capacity. Since smaller batteries hold less power, they also operate at full capacity.

Algorithm
We sort the batteries array to greedily process the largest batteries first, allowing us to efficiently identify and remove those that exceed the average runtime.

After sorting:

Compute total battery power (sum)
As long as the largest battery >sum/n:
Assign it to one computer permanently
Update: n←n−1 and sum←sum−largest
Return sum/n as the final runtime
Time Complexity: O(mlogm)
Space Complexity: O(1)

    while (batteries.at(-1) > parseInt(sum / n)) {
        n--;
        sum -= batteries.pop();
    }

    return parseInt(sum / n)

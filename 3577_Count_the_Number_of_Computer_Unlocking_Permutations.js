/**
 * 3577. Count the Number of Computer Unlocking Permutations
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * You are given an array complexity of length n.

There are n locked computers in a room with labels from 0 to n - 1, each with its own unique password. The password of the computer i has a complexity complexity[i].

The password for the computer labeled 0 is already decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:

You can decrypt the password for the computer i using the password for computer j, where j is any integer less than i with a lower complexity. (i.e. j < i and complexity[j] < complexity[i])
To decrypt the password for computer i, you must have already unlocked a computer j such that j < i and complexity[j] < complexity[i].
Find the number of permutations of [0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)] that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer 0 as the only initially unlocked one.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that the password for the computer with label 0 is decrypted, and not the computer with the first position in the permutation.

 

Example 1:

Input: complexity = [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The valid permutations are:

[0, 1, 2]
Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] < complexity[1].
Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 1 since complexity[1] < complexity[2].
[0, 2, 1]
Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] < complexity[2].
Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] < complexity[1].
Example 2:

Input: complexity = [3,3,3,4,4,4]

Output: 0

Explanation:

There are no possible permutations which can unlock all computers.

 

Constraints:

2 <= complexity.length <= 105
1 <= complexity[i] <= 109

/**
 * Approach
Let n = length of complexity.

Scan the array once:

Find minVal = minimum complexity.
Count how many times this minVal appears.
If:

complexity[0] != minVal or
count(minVal) != 1
→ return 0 (no valid unlocking order).
Otherwise:

We must put 0 at position 0 in the permutation.
The remaining n-1 indices can be arranged in any order.
So result = (n-1)! mod 1e9+7.
Compute factorial iteratively:

ans = 1
For i from 2 to n-1:
ans = (ans * i) % MOD
Return ans.

/**
 * 1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * The pair sum of a pair (a,b) is equal to a + b. The maximum pair sum is the largest pair sum in a list of pairs.

For example, if we have pairs (1,5), (2,3), and (4,4), the maximum pair sum would be max(1+5, 2+3, 4+4) = max(6, 5, 8) = 8.
Given an array nums of even length n, pair up the elements of nums into n / 2 pairs such that:

Each element of nums is in exactly one pair, and
The maximum pair sum is minimized.
Return the minimized maximum pair sum after optimally pairing up the elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: The elements can be paired up into pairs (3,3) and (5,2).
The maximum pair sum is max(3+3, 5+2) = max(6, 7) = 7.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,5,4,2,4,6]
Output: 8
Explanation: The elements can be paired up into pairs (3,5), (4,4), and (6,2).
The maximum pair sum is max(3+5, 4+4, 6+2) = max(8, 8, 8) = 8.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
2 <= n <= 105
n is even.
1 <= nums[i] <= 105

/**
 * Intuition
Sort the array.
Start to access from left starting from array's as 0.
At the same time Start to access from right starting from array's as nums.length - 1.
Approach
Sort the array.
Add the value of nums in 1st and last index, Which is the 1st min and 1st max.
Continue it until pairs is available.
Find the maximum_sum among it.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n log n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

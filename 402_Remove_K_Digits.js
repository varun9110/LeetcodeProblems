/**
 * 402. Remove K Digits
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, 
 * return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

Example 1:
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

Constraints:
1 <= k <= num.length <= 105
num consists of only digits.
num does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

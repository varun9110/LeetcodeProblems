/**
 * 2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.

 

Example 1:

Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
Example 2:

Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. 
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.
 

Constraints:

n == spells.length
m == potions.length
1 <= n, m <= 105
1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105
1 <= success <= 1010
 */

/**
 * Approach
Sort the potions array (ascending).

For each spell:

compute need = ceil(success / spell) (the smallest potion value that makes the product â‰¥ success).
binary search in potions to find the first index idx where potions[idx] >= need.
the answer for this spell is m - idx where m = len(potions).
Return answers in the same order as spells.

/**
 * 3510. Minimum Pair Removal to Sort Array II
 * Difficulty: hard
 * 
 * Given an array nums, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select the adjacent pair with the minimum sum in nums. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
Replace the pair with their sum.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.

An array is said to be non-decreasing if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).


Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The pair (3,1) has the minimum sum of 4. After replacement, nums = [5,2,4].
The pair (2,4) has the minimum sum of 6. After replacement, nums = [5,6].
The array nums became non-decreasing in two operations.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The array nums is already sorted.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

/**
 * Intuition
We want to make the array non-decreasing using the minimum number of operations.
Each operation is forced: we must always pick the adjacent pair with the minimum sum (leftmost if tied) and replace it with their sum.

A brute-force simulation would be too slow because removing elements repeatedly costs too much.
So we need a way to:

Always find the minimum adjacent pair quickly
Efficiently update neighbors after a removal
Track whether the array is already non-decreasing
This leads to using a min-heap combined with a linked-list simulation.

Approach
Simulate a linked list

Use two arrays left and right to represent neighbors of each index.
This allows O(1) removals and neighbor updates.
Min-heap of adjacent sums

Store (nums[i] + nums[i+1], i) in a min-heap.
The heap always gives the smallest valid adjacent pair.
Lazy deletion is used: outdated heap entries are skipped.
Track disorder

Maintain a counter rest = number of indices where nums[i] > nums[i+1].
When rest == 0, the array is non-decreasing.
Process removals

Pop the minimum-sum pair (i, right[i]).
Update rest by removing old violations and adding new ones.
Merge the pair and reconnect neighbors.
Push newly formed adjacent pairs into the heap.
Repeat

Continue until rest == 0.
Count how many merges were performed.
Complexity
Time Complexity:
O(n log n)

Each merge uses heap operations
At most n - 1 merges
Space Complexity:
O(n)

/**
 * 135. Candy
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * 
 * There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

Constraints:

n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

 * Approach
■ Step 1
Intialize total_candies with len(ratings) because at least all children has one candy.

■ Step 2
We iterate through ratings one by one.

case1
if ratings[i] == ratings[i - 1]:
we don't have to give a candy to the current i child because current i child has the same rating with previous child. Just increment i and continue.

case2
while i < n and ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
This case indicates that the current i child has higher raiting than i - 1 previous child. In this case, we need to give candies to the current i child.

Add +1 to current_peak and add current_peak to total_candies and incremtnt i. this process continues until we don't meet case2 while condition above.

Let me explain current_peak in "How it works" section.

case3
while i < n and ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1]:
This case indicates that the current i child has lower raiting than i - 1 previous child. In this case, actually we do the same thing of case2. Because even if input is decreasing order [9,5,3,1], we need to give candies to the current i child. In the end, total candies are 10 [4,3,2,1]. we need some extra candies.

Add +1 to current_valley and add current_valley to total_candies and incremtnt i. this process continues until we don't meet case 3 while condition above.

Let me explain current_valley in "How it works" section.

In the last of Step 2, subtract minium of current_peak or current_valley from total_candies.

How it works
Let's think with this input.

Input: ratings = [2,4,6,7,3,2,2]
total_candies(Let's say "total") = 7 (length of input array)
current_peak(Let's say "peak") = 0
current_valley(Let's say "valley") = 0
In Step2, starting from index 1.

■ Case2
condtion: while i < n and ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:

index 1 > index 0, so peak = 1, valley = 0, total = 8 (7 + 1)
index 2 > index 1, so peak = 2, valley = 0, total = 10 (8 + 2)
index 3 > index 2, so peak = 3, valley = 0, total = 13 (10 + 3)
index 4 < index 3, then stop Case2

Our code distrubtes candies like this so far
from [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
to   [1,2,3,4,1,1,1](total 13 candies)
■ Case3
condtion: while i < n and ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1]:

index 4 < index 3, so peak = 3, valley = 1, total = 14 (13 + 1)
index 5 < index 4, so peak = 3, valley = 2, total = 16 (14 + 2)
index 6 == index 5, then stop Case3

Our code distrubtes candies like this so far
from [1,2,3,4,1,1,1](Case2)
to   [1,2,3,4,2,3,1](total 16 candies)
Let me explain total_candies -= min(current_peak, current_valley)
Before that, the last rating(index 6) is equal to index 5, so we don't do anything(meet Case1). Let me skip it.

Now Look at this. When ratings = [2,4,6,7,3,2,2]

This is real distribution, In other words, the minimum number of
candies you need to have to distribute

[1,2,3,4,2,1,1] = 14 candies
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
[0,1,2,3,1,0,0](additional candies for each children)
How our code distributes candies

[1,2,3,4,2,3,1] = 16 candies
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
[0,1,2,3,1,2,0](additional candies for each children)
Compare distribution of adittional candies.

[0,1,2,3,1,0,0](Real)
[0,1,2,3,1,2,0](Our code)
Our code distributes extra 2 candies at index 5 which is equal to minimum of current_peak or current_valley. That's because actually we add peaks twice as a peak and as a valley in Case2 and Case3. For this question, we need peak value only once. More precisely, we need only higher peak between range of one of peak and valley combinations(in this case between index1 and index5), because of constraints from the description saying "Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors".

That's why we need to substract minimum peak from total_candies. In this case 16 - 2. peak = 3 vs valley = 2

Output: 14
Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
'n' is the number of elements in the 'ratings' list. This is because we are using a single loop to iterate through the ratings, and within the loop, we perform constant time operations.

Space complexity: O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of additional memory regardless of the size of the 'ratings' list. The only variables that consume memory are 'n', 'total_candies', 'i', 'current_peak', and 'current_valley', and these variables do not depend on the input size 'n'.

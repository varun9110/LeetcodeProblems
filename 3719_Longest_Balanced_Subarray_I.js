/**
 * 3719. Longest Balanced Subarray I
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * You are given an integer array nums.

A subarray is called balanced if the number of distinct even numbers in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct odd numbers.

Return the length of the longest balanced subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,4,3]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest balanced subarray is [2, 5, 4, 3].
It has 2 distinct even numbers [2, 4] and 2 distinct odd numbers [5, 3]. Thus, the answer is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,5,4]

Output: 5

Explanation:

The longest balanced subarray is [3, 2, 2, 5, 4].
It has 2 distinct even numbers [2, 4] and 2 distinct odd numbers [3, 5]. Thus, the answer is 5.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The longest balanced subarray is [2, 3, 2].
It has 1 distinct even number [2] and 1 distinct odd number [3]. Thus, the answer is 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1500
1 <= nums[i] <= 105

/**
 * Intuition
A balanced subarray has equal counts of distinct even and distinct odd numbers.

The solution uses a brute force approach to check all possible subarrays while tracking distinct elements.

A trivial solution would use two Hash Sets to track distinct even and odd numbers, clearing them for each new starting position.

However, this creates unnecessary overhead from repeated allocations and clearing operations.

Approach
Instead of creating a new Set for each new subarray, we use a Lazy array clearing with an Iteration marker as reset.

Each starting position i gets a unique marker value i+1, and we store this marker in the seen array when we encounter an element.

An element is considered new for the current subarray if its stored marker does not match the current iteration marker.

Algorithm
This technique avoids expensive set operations by reusing a single array across all iterations.

Instead of full reset, we simply change what we consider valid data.

For iteration i, the marker is i+1:

When seen[val]=i+1: element already counted in current subarray
When seen[val]

=i+1: element not yet seen in current subarray

By incrementing the iteration marker for each new starting position, old data becomes automatically invalid without any clearing operation.

This provides O(1) lookup and update per element.

The parity check val&1 determines even (0) versus odd (1), directing each distinct element to the correct counter.

Since we check all O(n 
2
 ) possible subarrays, we guarantee finding the longest balanced subarray.

Time Complexity: O(n

 )
Space Complexity: O(1) or O(max)

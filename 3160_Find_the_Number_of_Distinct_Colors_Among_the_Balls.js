/**
 * 3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * You are given an integer limit and a 2D array queries of size n x 2.

There are limit + 1 balls with distinct labels in the range [0, limit]. Initially, all balls are uncolored. 
For every query in queries that is of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y. After each query, 
you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.

Return an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of distinct colors after ith query.
Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.


Example 1:
Input: limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,2,3]
Explanation:

After query 0, ball 1 has color 4.
After query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.
After query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.
After query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.
Example 2:
Input: limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: [1,2,2,3,4]
Explanation:

After query 0, ball 0 has color 1.
After query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.
After query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.
After query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.
After query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= limit <= 109
1 <= n == queries.length <= 105
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit
1 <= queries[i][1] <= 109
 */

/**
 * Intuition:
Track Colors: Maintain a map recording each ballâ€™s current color.
Count Frequencies: Keep a frequency map for how many balls have each color.
Update on Repaint: For every query, if a ball is repainted, decrement the count of its old color (removing it if zero) and increment the new colorâ€™s count.

8	[5, ðŸŸ£]	Paint ball 5 with ðŸŸ£	1: ðŸŸ¡, 2: ðŸ”µ, 3: ðŸŸ¢, 4: ðŸ”´, 5: ðŸŸ£	{ðŸŸ¡, ðŸ”µ, ðŸŸ¢, ðŸ”´, ðŸŸ£} â†’ 5
9	[1, ðŸ”´]	Repaint ball 1 from ðŸŸ¡ to ðŸ”´	1: ðŸ”´, 2: ðŸ”µ, 3: ðŸŸ¢, 4: ðŸ”´, 5: ðŸŸ£	{ðŸ”´, ðŸ”µ, ðŸŸ¢, ðŸŸ£} â†’ 4
10	[2, ðŸŸ¡]	Repaint ball 2 from ðŸ”µ to ðŸŸ¡	1: ðŸ”´, 2: ðŸŸ¡, 3: ðŸŸ¢, 4: ðŸ”´, 5: ðŸŸ£	{ðŸ”´, ðŸŸ¡, ðŸŸ¢, ðŸŸ£} â†’ 4
Complexity:

Time: (O(n)) on average for processing (n) queries.
Space: (O(n)) in the worst case for the maps.

/**
 * 914. X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * You are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.

Partition the cards into one or more groups such that:

Each group has exactly x cards where x > 1, and
All the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.
Return true if such partition is possible, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].
Example 2:

Input: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
 

Constraints:

1 <= deck.length <= 104
0 <= deck[i] < 104

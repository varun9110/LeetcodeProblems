/**
 * 1536. Minimum Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Given an n x n binary grid, in one step you can choose two adjacent rows of the grid and swap them.

A grid is said to be valid if all the cells above the main diagonal are zeros.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to make the grid valid, or -1 if the grid cannot be valid.

The main diagonal of a grid is the diagonal that starts at cell (1, 1) and ends at cell (n, n).


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,0]]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: All rows are similar, swaps have no effect on the grid.
Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: 0

Constraints:
n == grid.length == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 200
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1

/**
 * Intuition
To make the grid valid, every row i must have at least (n - i - 1) trailing zeros. Because:
Row 0 → needs n-1 zeros
Row 1 → needs n-2 zeros
Row 2 → needs n-3 zeros
...
Last row → needs 0 zeros
So instead of swapping the whole grid, we:
Count trailing zeros in each row.
Try to place a valid row at each position.
If a valid row is below, bring it up using adjacent swaps.
Count swaps.
If no row satisfies requirement → return -1.
Approach
Create array zeros[] storing trailing zeros of each row.
For each index i:
Required zeros = n - i - 1
Find first row j ≥ i where zeros[j] >= required
If not found → return -1
Move row j to i using adjacent swaps
Add swaps to answer
Return total swaps
This works because:
We greedily fix rows from top to bottom.
Bringing the closest valid row minimizes swaps.
Complexity
Time complexity: O(n²)
Space complexity: O(n)
